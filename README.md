### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Rasmus Fogelberg

Welcome to my corner of Github. Here you can browse through all my repos for school assignments for my Web Development education. This June I will hold a Higher Education Diploma with specialization in Computer Engineering. I can with confidence say that coding is something I look forward to be able to do for a living.
